# Reflection for Lab 1

What did you like/not like about Python
I admire Python's simplicity and clarity, mainly for defining functions and instructions. Unlike C/C++, Python doesnâ€™t require specific kind declarations, which makes the code purifier and quicker to write. For instance, setting up easy functions like factorial or Fibonacci is greater straightforward due to Python's flexible coping with of statistics sorts and its considerable general library.Python's dynamic typing was both a boon and a marvel. Unlike C/C++, in which you have to strictly outline variable types, 

Was there anything that behaved differently than you expected in Python?
Python permits greater flexibility. However, this will cause sudden runtime errors if not careful, in particular coming from a strongly typed history wherein kind checks at compilation offer early errors detection. Python's memory control is extra abstracted in comparison to C/C++. In C/C++, managing reminiscence allocation and deallocation is manual and precise, presenting greater manipulate but additionally growing complexity.

Based on what you wrote in your lab, write something about the similarities and differences between Python with C/C++ and how that affects how you write your program.
Python automates this with a garbage collector, simplifying the development process however sometimes at the price of performance. This impacts how I method programming duties, mainly while performance and aid control are vital.
